# Springboard_capstone_project_1
As part of Springboard's Data Science career track this repo contains files and jupyter notebooks related to my first
capstone project. This project focuses on predicting energy consumption of the entire region in southern CA served by the SDGE (San Diego Gas and electric) utility (which comes under CAISO) based on the past 5 years of hourly energy consumption data. 

#### File descriptions:
###### [Initial_project_proposal.docx]()
Contains the initial project proposal 
###### Capstone Project 1_ Data Wrangling.docx 
Contains the basic data import and cleaning steps carried out on the hourly energy consumption data from CAISO
###### Capstone1_CAISO_hourly_energy_import&clean_data.ipynb (moved to Archive)
Contains the code for importing the data directly from CAISO's website; also includes data cleaning.
###### Capstone_SDGE_hourly_energy_data_exploration.ipynb (moved to Archive)
Contains basic data exploration on the cleaned data; focusing on San Diego region for now
###### Capstone_SDGE_hourly_energy_statistical_analysis.ipynb (moved to Archive)
Merging the energy data with weather and PV installations data and doing some basic data explorations and statistical analysis

###### Capstone1_SDGE_hourly_energy_milestone.ipynb
A single notebook file including data import of energy, weather and PV installation data files, Exploring the data files, doing statistical analysis, finding trends among energy, weather and PV installated capacity data.
